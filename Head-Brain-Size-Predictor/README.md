# 🧠 Head-Brain Size Predictor

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model using **scikit-learn** to predict **brain weight based on head size**. It uses a dataset of human head sizes and corresponding brain weights.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

The goal is to understand the relationship between **head size (in cm³)** and **brain weight (in grams)** and predict brain weight using a linear regression model.
